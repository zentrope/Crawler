# Crawler

A website crawler written in [Gerbil Scheme](https://cons.io). There's nothing to see at the moment because I've just started working on this project.

This is going to be an _overdone_ and (probably) _overly abstracted_ project so I can explore things that interest me if I were ever to write something larger in Scheme.

Also, this crawler doesn't make requests against web sites, rather, it uses a running chromedriver instance to make the requests so that the pages it crawls are fully rendered.

Finally, I develop on MacOS, so this project isn't likely to work all that well on FreeBSD or Linux. I mean, until I do something about it.

How to build, yadda, yadda, when there's something to build.
